MyVideoBuzz -- Protuhj's Fork
=============

This project is a fork of https://github.com/jesstech/Roku-YouTube. Updates include API change fixes, the addition of new features, and the removal of OAuth settings.

**Note: Versions up to and including 1.7.4 will not work (that well) with YouTube as of 7 May 2015.**

Installation
============

Enable development mode on your Roku Streaming Player with the following remote control sequence:

**Note: This code cannot be entered from a mobile app (iOS, Android, etc.). You must use a physical Roku remote!**

    Home 3x, Up 2x, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right

On newer versions of the Roku firmware, you will then be prompted to set the web server password. Choose a password (and remember it!), then reboot the Roku.

When development mode is enabled on your Roku, you can install dev packages
from the Application Installer which runs on your device at your device's IP
address. Open any standard web browser and visit the following URL:

    http://<rokuPlayer-ip-address> (for example, http://192.168.1.7)

[Download the source as a zip](https://github.com/Protuhj/myvideobuzz/releases/download/v2.0.0/MyVideoBuzz_v2_0_0.zip) and upload it to your Roku device.
**Do not unzip this file! Upload the whole file to your Roku!**

Due to limitations in the sandboxing of development Roku channels, you can only have one development channel installed at a time.

### Alternative Installation Method - Windows users

Download the whole repository [hereâ€”Current Release: 2.0.0](https://github.com/Protuhj/myvideobuzz/archive/v2.0.0.zip)
Unzip the archive, edit the \deploy\rokus.txt file, and add your Roku device(s) to the text file, similar to this example:

    <Roku IP><space>rokudev:<rokupassword>
    192.168.1.56 rokudev:rokupassword

This will upload the myvideobuzz.zip file to the Rokus you provide in the rokus.txt file.

You can copy the .\deploy\ folder somewhere on your hard drive, and modify the deploy.bat file to change the location of the zip file. Do so by changing the ZIP_LOCATION variable to point to the location of the zip you would like to deploy.

By doing this, you won't have to edit the rokus.txt file in the future when updating your Roku(s).

### Updating the channel

As of version 1.7.2, the channel supports auto-updating. That means that once the channel is installed, you can update it from within the channel itself.

* There are three ways the channel can update itself:<br/>
  1) A New Release (i.e. version is greater than the current version installed on your Roku, like 1.7.4 vs. 1.7.3).<br/>
  2) The current master (development) build has a newer version (major, minor, build #) than the currently installed version.<br/>
  3) Force the current latest release.

* **The only requirement needed to use this feature is to enter your Roku password (recall that you set a password while enabling development mode).**
  * This can be accomplished by going into the "Settings" item on the channel's main page, then the "General" item, then choosing the "Roku Development Password" item, and entering your Roku's password. (Hint: the username is "rokudev" if that jars your memory.)
  * Once you've entered your password, go back to the main "Settings" page, and go to "About" -- you can then use the buttons at the bottom of the screen to choose which update option you'd like.

* Note: if a channel update is successful, there is no notification as such, it will just restart itself, similar to when you normally re-upload the channel's zip file.

### Usage

This channel uses publicly available information from your YouTube account. To permit full channel functionality, you will need to ensure that your account Subscriptions, Playlists, and Favorites are publicly accessible.

* To do this, go to https://www.youtube.com/account_privacy and make sure the checkboxes under "Likes and Subscriptions" are unchecked.  
* Then, go to https://www.youtube.com/view_all_playlists to manage which playlists you would like to be visible in VideoBuzz.   
    * Click on the 'Edit' button next to each playlist you would like to change.
    * Then, on the next page, click "Playlist settings" and change the "PLAYLIST PRIVACY" to Public.

### Debugging

Your Roku's debug console can be accessed by telnet at port 8085:

    telnet <rokuPlayer-ip-address> 8085
