Version 2.1 Build 001
    - Initial parsing of DASH manifests for HD playback.
    - The channel will now attempt to play DASH first, if it fails, try playing the video again.
    - If DASH fails, then it will fall back to SD playback.
    - If you force video quality to 'lowest' in the settings, the channel won't attempt to get the DASH stream.
    - Currently, music videos don't work with DASH, so if you don't want to be annoyed with having to play videos twice, just force quality to lowest.
